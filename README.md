## 🛠️ My Process

### Built With

- ✅ Semantic **HTML5**
- 🎨 **CSS Grid** + Flexbox for layout mastery
- 💡 **CSS custom properties** for theme consistency
- 🧩 **Component-based architecture**
- 💅 **Styled with love** — a modern, SaaS-inspired aesthetic
- ✅ **Mobile-first** responsive design
- 🚀 *Optional*: React / Next.js (if you used them)

### What I Learned

This project was more than pixels and grids — it was about *communicating product value visually*. Key takeaways:

```css
.card-img {
  width: 100%;
  max-height: 160px;
  object-fit: contain;
}
### 🔄 Continued Development

- I'd like to enhance interactivity using JavaScript (or React).
- Adding dark mode would be a fun next step.
- Animations using Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth transitions.
